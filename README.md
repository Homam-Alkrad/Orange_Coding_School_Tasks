# Orange_Coding_School_Tasks
Iâ€™ve created this GitHub repository to showcase my work on tasks from Orange Coding School. It includes projects that highlight my programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of core concepts. Each project features well-structured code, effective algorithms, and a user-friendly interface.
